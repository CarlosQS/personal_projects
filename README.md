# FELKTEK
This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar encryption and decryption algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Caesar cipher is a type of substitution encryption that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter that is a specified number of positions ahead or behind in the alphabet

## How to Use
To use FELKTEK's Caesar encryption/decryption tool, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source files
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser
2. Select the desired operation ("Encrypt" or "Decrypt") using the radio button
3. Enter the shift value, which indicates how many positions the letters should be moved
4. Specify the length of the alphabet using the modulus value
5. Choose the letter case option you want to apply: keep case, lowercase, or uppercase
6. Optionally, select the foreign key to remove symbols if desired
7. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input field provided
   
Click the "Submit" button.
The result will be displayed in the output section

## Example
### Encryption:
If you want to encrypt the message "HELLO" with an offset of 3, the ciphertext will be "KROD"

### Decryption:
To decrypt the ciphertext "KROD" with an offset of 3, the plaintext "HELLO" will be retrieved

### Project Files
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html:** The HTML file containing the user interface and embedded JavaScript code.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the page.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the implementation of the Caesar encryption algorithm.
- **README.md:** The README file with information about the project and how to use it.
## Browser Support
This Caesar encryption/decryption tool from FELKTEK should work fine in most modern browsers that support JavaScript. No additional libraries or frameworks are required.
